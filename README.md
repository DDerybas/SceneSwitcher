# Scene Switcher
A simple Unity editor extension that allows you to quickly switch between scenes from the Scenes window via a drop-down list.


To activate the drop-down toolbar, select the Scene window, press the tilde key and select Scene Switcher overlay.

## Installation
Just download the sample project from here and use the contents of the **SceneSwitcher** folder.

Scenes that need to be used with the toolbar should be located in the **Scenes** folder along the **Assets/Scenes path**.

>To change this you can change the path value of the **SCENES_PATH** variable in the **SceneSwitcherDropdown.cs** script in the **SceneSwitcher\Assets\SceneSwitcher\Editor\Scripts** folder
